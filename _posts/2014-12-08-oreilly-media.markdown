[O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com/) has been at the forefront of tech publishing for a long while. I used to buy their books around 15 years ago as I was teaching myself HTML and CSS.

Today is Cyber Monday, I guess, and O'Reilly has 50% off of every ebook and video.

I spent about 15 minutes roaming around the website. Kid in a candy store. I ended up realizing I shouldn't go crazy so I just bought one book.

[JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 6th Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do)

I've seen this book for a while and at 1096 pages...it'll be a great reference.
