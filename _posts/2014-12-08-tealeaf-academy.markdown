I've decided to formalize my obsession with learning to program.

Over the years I have dabbled in PHP, Python and HTML, CSS, etc. 
I've also given a lot of money to [O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com/). 
I had stacks of paper copies while I was doing graphic design which has seamlessly lead into ebooks. 
Many of them :)

So, I'm learning [Ruby on Rails](www.rubyonrails.org) which is a framework to make web apps with the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language. 
And I'm learning it with the help of [Tealeaf Academy](http://www.gotealeaf.com/). 
I've been coding on my days off and when I can squeeze in any time. 
Not good for the flow but I've limited time when I can get to this. 
Almost two months into it I'm halfway through the first course...which is a four week course. 
Did I say this is self paced? The instructors and TAs are cool though and would rather you learn it than power through. 

And on this Thanksgiving Day I give thanks to my wonderful wife and her support, my family and my lifelong love of learning. 
The future is looking pretty bright.
