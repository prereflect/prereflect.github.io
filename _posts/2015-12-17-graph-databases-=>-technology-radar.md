title: Graph Databases => Technology Radar
---

I'm putting graph databases on my technology radar. I listened to an interview
about [Neo4jf](http://neo4j.com) on [Ruby Rouges](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/236-rr-neo4j-with-brian-underwood)
 and it was very interesting.

I need to stay away from shiny new things right now but I did download the free 
ebook [Graph Databases 2nd Edition](http://neo4j.com/books/graph-databases/)
 from Neo4j.
