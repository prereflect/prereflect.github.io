I've finishing the first course at Tealeaf Academy, [Introduction to Ruby and Web Development](http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!ruby), and it has been an incredible experience. I am 1/3 of the way through their *3-Course Professional Grade Curriculum* for learning [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)...and we have not touched Rails yet! We do have a solid grounding in the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language and an understanding of Object Oriented Programming. I also, probably, learned more about the card game Blackjack than I need to know...because, I just don't care for gambling. In this first course I have written 3 apps to play this game. [Procedural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) Blackjack, [Object Oriented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) Blackjack, and Blackjack as a web app made with the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) DSL.  

I've always been interested in information and computers. I went back to school for journalism but when I started working on the Macintosh computers in the lab I became enamoured with and switched to graphic design as my major. This was in 1996 which meant print design. Completing 4 years of schooling and I became a graphic designer working in print. I should have realized that I would end up in programming when I would worry more about how *clean* the design was and spent an inordinate amount of time working with the libraries in QuarkXPress and setting up all of the different styles for items and paragraphs etc.  

As the web took off I started to teach myself html and css. I am into standards so it was all about hand-coding XHTML and the emerging CSS2 in BBEdit, then Textmate, for the static web pages that I was marking up and putting on the web. Why was everyone chopping up Photoshop images? During this time I probably wouldn't even have considered myself a *Hobbyist*.  

A wrong turn into marketing/distribution with a little design work lead me abruptly out of design and back into retail. After almost a decade of retail management with Trader Joe's and I haven't been able to shake the desire to learn programming. [O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com/) has made a fair amount of money from me from paper and now ebooks. Time for a another career change!  

In my spare time I had completed Michael Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) and subscribed to Daniel Kehoe's [RailsApps](http://railsapps.github.io/) for a few months building a few example web apps but nothing really stuck. I even managed to forget most of what I learned completing the Ruby track at [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/twoller). Cutting and Pasting all of these tutorials was helping but I needed to get more structured in my quest to becoming a programmer. After a lot of Googling I realized I wouldn't be able to move to San Francisco and spend 17K so I started researching online *bootcamps*. I always came back to Tealeaf Academy after following links all over the web about other online schools and the people who have graduated from them. I certainly have made the right choice.  

Tealeaf Academy is self paced. You get out of it what you put into it. With TAs living in most time zones around the world you will get a response to your questions very quickly. All of the TAs and one of the founders are very active in the discussion forums and there are weekly *live sessions* and daily *Office Hours*.  

Here is one of my resolutions for the new year. Be more active in the forums and attend one of the live sessions a week. During this first course I found myself spinning my wheels too long trying to understand some of the topics. I believe this a holdover from my years of on-again, off-again self teaching. The TAs and other students at Tealeaf are eager to jump in and help. I'm going to ask more for help.  

A couple of things that I will be working on during the next two courses are staying with the program and focus a lot harder on the immediate goals of the lessons and not let my curiosity wander.  

While being proud of what I've accomplished in the first course I think it has come a little harder because of the way I've approached the lessons. By the end I was getting better but I think I went off on tangents when I should have followed the solutions more closely and absorbed the solid methods and ideas being offered. I would get an idea in my head on how to write the code and then go from there googling all over the web to make it happen the way I had envisioned.  

I'm going to put on the blinders also for the next few months. It has taken me approximately 3 times as long as the suggested amount of time to complete the first course. I am a very curious person when it comes to programming. One of the best things to come along for me was [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) for chromebooks. It has allowed me to program on my only computer. A Samsung Chromebook by running a chroot with [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) GNU/Linux Sid installed. I'm comfortable with Linux but I've also spent some time just trying stuff out. Install Go and it's environment onto my chromebook just because I can. Sure!  

Now is the time for me to focus!  

My wife asks me all of the time if I still like all of this. I tell her that I love it. It is still very exciting and with the help of Tealeaf Academy I am going to have a much more dynamic and interesting profession sometime this year.
