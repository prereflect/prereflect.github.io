In the interest of having a truly mobile Vim setup I've switched my plugin
 manager from [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to
 [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

With this plugin you can keep all of your plugin information in your .vimrc
 file and install, update, etc from Vim itself.
